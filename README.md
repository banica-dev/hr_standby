Description:  

This custom Odoo module enhances the functionality of the standard Odoo HR module by introducing a "standby" button, a new model, and a menu item. This extension is designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing employee standby periods. Key features include:  

1. **Standby Button:** We have added an intuitive button to allow users to set and manage employee standby states directly from the Odoo interface.
  
2. **Standby Model:** We have introduced a standby model that stores detailed information about employee standby periods, such as start date, end date, and other relevant information.

3. **Custom Menu Item:** With a new menu item, access to the standby functionality becomes straightforward and seamlessly integrated into the HR Odoo workflow. This custom module offers an efficient and user-friendly solution for standby management, enhancing the Odoo user experience and extending the capabilities of the standard HR module. Use it to optimize your staff management processes and ensure that your HR operations are more efficient and organized than ever before.
